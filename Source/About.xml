	Forgelings

	Long ago, a tribe of industrial zealots dabbled in an experimental technology that fused man and machine, giving rise to the Forgelings. A blend of steel and flesh, Forgelings consume chemfuel and wood to fuel a burning furnace within their chests. Pummeling metals into shape with their hammer-like fists, heating it with their burning forges, Forgelings make for excellent smiths.

	Race Features
	Forgelings live to smith metals, and can do so on their own unique spots. Their stomachs a literal furnace, they burn wood and other fuels to power themselves, just watch out! They literally bleed fire. With fists of steel, they can pummel enemies to much in a pinch. They also tend to be more crafty or artistic by default.

	Plate
	Used mostly to regulate their internal heat, Forgelings created this unique armor to compliment their bizarre physiology.

	Helm
	Adorned with smokestacks, this helm makes for a formidable and intimidating armor piece for Forgelings

	Dagger
	A blazing heat builds within a micro-forge in this dagger, channeled from the Forgeling itself. The slightest cut can painfully sear flesh.

	Forgeling Spot
	Forgelings can forge metals practically anywhere, their fists the hammer, their thighs the anvil. If you need a forge and smelter on the go, bring a Forgeling. Just mind the heat.
